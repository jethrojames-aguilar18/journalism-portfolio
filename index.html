                    <h1 class="text-align-justify">When Rainy Season Begins</h1>
                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar  |  Published on August 11, 2018</p><br>
                    <p>Rainy Season has set foot!
                        <br><br>
                        Over the past days, ceaseless heavy rains continue to pound Luzon which may lead to an increase of diseases related to contaminated water, floods and mosquitos 
                        which greatly affects the Filipinos, particularly in Metro Manila.
                        <br><br>
                        Here are five rainy day diseases that the public should watch out for this rainy season, as listed by the Department of Health (DOH).
                        <br><br>
                        1.   Typhoid Fever - 
                        It is a type of enteric fever, along with paratyphoid fever. The cause is the bacterium Salmonella Typhi, also known as Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, 
                        growing in the intestines and blood.Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person.
                        <br><br>
                        2.   Cholera - Cholera is an infectious disease that causes severe watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and even death if untreated. It is caused 
                        by eating food or drinking water contaminated with a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae.
                        <br><br>
                        3.   Leptospirosis - Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals. It is caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira. In humans, 
                        it can cause a wide range of symptoms, some of which may be mistaken for other diseases. Some infected persons, however, may have no symptoms at all.
                         <br><br>
                         4.   Influenza - Influenza, commonly known as "the flu", is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus. Symptoms can be mild to severe. The most 
                         common symptoms include: high fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pains, headache, coughing, sneezing, and feeling tired.
                        <br><br>
                        5.   Dengue - Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection.
                        This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash.
                        <br><br>
                        Prevention is better than cure! Have yourself a good lifestyle so that you would not feel any symptoms given above. If so, consult your physician immediately 
                        to help you cure the symptoms to halt the sickness to grow and adapt to your body. Doing so, you can enjoy your day free from sickness.</p><br><hr/>

                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James Aguilar  |  Published on October 20, 2018 </p><br>
                    <p>This year, the Sergio Osmena Sr. High School had started the Environmental Protection and Waste Management Department (EPWMD) to protect and to teach 
                        students how to property throw trashes, and to replace Zero Waste Program (ZWP) for it became unsuccessful in keeping the school Cean and Green last year. 
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>How ZWP became unsuccessful</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        With the partnership of Youth for Environment in Schools Organization (YES-O) and Science Club, ZWP was conducted to lessen and to teach the students the 
                        correct way of throwing trashes:segregation.
                        <br><br>
                        They first distributed 3 trashcans with descriptions: Biodegradable, Non-Biodegradable and Recycled Materials respectively to be filled and will be collected 
                        every end of the week. At first, it was successful but as weeks pass, many students thought of it as boring which made the ZWP unsuccessful.
                        <br><br>
                        "Cleaning is boring," this must what run to the minds of those irresponsible Osmenians, which is clearly futile. As an Osmenian, we shall halt these 
                        habits of highly irresponsible students instead be aware and awake of what's happening to the school and also to take action.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>As EPWMD started</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Due to the removal of ZWP, the SOSHS implemented a new environmental program which also aimed to minimize the inappropriate throwing
                         of trashesand to educate students how important environment is, starting from June onwards.
                         <br><br>
                        As a student, I have seen many changes regarding the environment which I could say that is effective. Straws are now prohibited on our School Canteen.
                        Sipping from a straw introduces air into the digestive tract. This can cause uncomfortable digestive symptoms, such as gas and bloating.

                        Also, just like the ZWP trashcans are distributed in every rooms to teach students how to segregate.
                        <br><br>
                        As an Editorial Writer, our job is to know which decision is the best because we are the Voice of the Nation, so implementing the EPWMD was so benefiai because since it was 
                        implemented, the SOSHS took one step closer in becoming a Clean and Green School.
                        <br><br>
                        So far this project continues to be successful but on the other hand,we cannot get rid of what happened to the ZWP that became unsuccessful due to lack of participation 
                        and discipline of some students.For this reason,it is not enough that project implementor is the only one that puts effort for this goal.This task requires manpower and effort 
                        by all students,teachers with the cooperation of government officials</p><br><hr/>

                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar  |  Published on November 29, 2019</p><br>
                    <p>We just went over Dengue, now enters the Polio Outbreak? What a sufficient proof that proves the Philippines as a vulnerable country. Striking up thousands of 
                        parents who worry about their children as it says that lower than 5 years old can be affected. Indeed, another outbreak to solve. 
                        <br><br>
                        Polio outbreak was recently declared in the Philippines by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Department of Health (DOH) last 
                        September 19, 2019. It returns to the Philippines after a 3 year old was reportedly diagnosed in Lanao Del Sur and this is the first case after WHO was declared polio-free 
                        last 2000.
                        <br><br>
                        Poliomyelitis commonly known as polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus that can lead into a lifelong paralysis or even death. Children in the country 
                        are at risk because of the debilitating disease.
                        <br><br>
                        Polio Outbreak is not a joke. It is incurable as said by the DOH. However, like other problems, a solution is always there. And the solution to Polio is none other than VACCINE!
                        <br><br>
                        DOH and partners are working together to respond to the comprehensive outbreak. One of the actions that they did was conducting a campaign called "Sabayang Patak Kontra 
                        Polio" wherein they reported 96% coverage of those who were being vaccinated against polio.
                        <br><br>
                        The Vaccination focuses on children below 5 years old to keep them protected as they grow up and be nurtured.
                         <br><br>
                        The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), a public-private partnership is supporting the campaign that the Philippine Government conducted. GPEI has its goal and that is 
                        to suppress the cases of polio nationwide. 
                        <br><br>
                        According to DOH, the vaccination campaign will expand in Metro Manila targeting 1,276, 658 under 5 year old and commenced in Davao and Lanao Del Sur last October this year. 
                        The campaign will spread around our country so that the cases will be eradicated.
                        <br><br>
                        The question is, if the vaccine is only to be applied to the children, then how about the old? The answer: they won't be getting any vaccines.
                        <br><br>
                        Why? Because the old people as proven by the DOH says that they have the lowest chance of having Polio. Lucky them!
                        <br><br>
                        To briefly summarize, let us uphold the quote, 'Prevention is better than Cure'. Before the situation worsens, let us prevent polio through Vaccination because there's no other cure than doing that.</p><br><hr/>

                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar  |  Published on November 29, 2019</p><br>
                    <p>
                        One of the requirements in any biological studies or life-science research is the observation of various histological and cytological specimens. Typically, a 
                        specimen is best studied if it is stained. However, not all school's are gifted with a very functional microscope but for a 15-year-old Junior High School 
                        Student like me to provide an alternative solution, it is undeniably brilliant!
                        <br><br>
                        Upon my journey as a Grade 10, several problems befell on my life, and the most memorable was my Grade 7 days.
                        <br><br>
                        Being a JHS student automatically requires studying microscopes so being a freshman, this is something I've been waiting for. However, the height of my 
                        expectations lowered for the reason that the microscopes that we're about to use show very unclear images. Therefore, how can we study that lesson if 
                        the medium for learning is very unfunctional?
                        <br><br>
                        This is when my research teacher Sir Alcayde that why don't I do a research about that by staining the specimens that were about to be lessons?'' And 
                        so I did it, but only when I am in Grade 10 so that I have access to our school's laboratory, in the point that I can reserve it for my own.
                        <br><br>
                        Mr. Alcayde told me to gather literature about staining and I found Mangosteen as a potential staining agent to help solve microscopic problems.
                        <br><br>
                        The specimens that I stained are two; a Plant Species and an Animal Species. I prepared it through the help of my research advisers and co-researchers.
                        <br><br>
                        Firstly, I removed the peels of the mangosteen and the rinds that I used to make 2 varying extracts, ethanolic and aqueous extracts. In the ethanolic extract, 
                        I subjected the macerated rinds to the 95% ethanol while I used 20 ml of distilled water for the aqueous extract. After that I prepared the plant and animal 
                        species which are Onion (Allium cepa) and Wild-type Fruit Fly (Drosophila Melanogaster).
                        <br><br>
                        For the staining part, I first stained the Onion. I got the cells from the onion, following the study of Basitah and for the next part is the fruit fly which I got 
                        out the larvae and the larva’s salivary glands for staining.
                        <br><br>
                        Jumping to the results, both of them were stained by the Mangosteen Rind Extract. Truly beneficial and helpful for the next generation.
                        <br><br>
                        Ofcourse, just like in any other research, I am also experiencing difficulties in my research since I am only a student researcher. I also have other priorities 
                        but I stepped out of that problem and faced it and here I am, A STUDENT RESEARCHER WHO CONTRIBUTED TO THE SOCIETY.
                        <br><br>
                        Now, my Research was recognized all over the Quezon City, for I won in the Division Level.
                        <br><br>
                        Being a student is not a hindrance for you to do what other things you want. Step out of your comfort zone and try to contribute to the world because as the saying 
                        goes, "Anything is possible."</p><br><hr/>

                    <p>Physically stable but mentally exhausted. This is the perfect way to describe students as they slowly increase the depression rate of the Philippines.
                        <br><br>
                        According to a statement from the Department of Health (DOH), "In the Philippines, 3.3 million Filipinos suffer from depressive disorders, with suicide 
                        rates in 2.5 males and 1.7 males per 100,000."
                        <br><br>
                        Depression, as a silent killer, is something that must not be overlooked. Depression, when left unattended can lead to suicide. And the more reason 
                        to solve it as early as we can.
                        <br><br>
                        The DOH noted that, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 800,000 die each year due to suicide. Medications and cognitive therapies 
                        may seem to be the best solution to the Depression but that doesn't mean that the spiritual side must be ignored.
                        <br><br>
                        Henceforth, this spiritual side must be something that is proven effective. Spiritual side that greatly favors us. And a spiritual side, that most of us
                        are in need to do. The answer: PRAYER!
                         <br><br>
                        Prayer is both inspirational and motivational. Prayer can heal emotional wounds by offering a safe way to vent the anger and anxiety that depression produces.
                         <br><br>
                        Battling depression is an uphill battle. Most of the time you're slipping back down the hill but that doesn't mean that going up again is something that you cannot do.
                         <br><br>
                        Feeling down will only prove your unfaithfulness to God. Let God solve all your problems because that's what we want.
                         <br><br>
                        As said by John Donne, No Man is an Island. Don't let your problem fool you. Solve it through God and solve it with God. And the only way we can deliver our 
                        problems to God is only through prayers.</p><br><hr/>

                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar  |  Published on November 29, 2019</p><br>
                    <p>"Without water, there isn't life." However, in the case of several cities, the quote turned back at them as some endures spending a day without 
                        getting in contact with water. This sad occurrence started in the time where our own water dams are slowly getting dried up as water supply becomes limited.
                        <br><br>
                        According to Michael Vargas, he saw a man filling water containers from a neighbor's tap in Bataan, Quezon City yesterday morning, hours ahead of the 
                        scheduled water supply interruption that started in October 2019.
                        <br><br>
                        Just by hearing water interruption, panic is expected of many. Ofcourse, no one will agree with the water interruption as it is disturbing how our lifestyle was.
                        <br><br>
                        For a simple family who only want to eat 3 square meals a day, this is something they are disappointed about. Eating without water, such shame! The water 
                        interruption truly affected most of us. Waking up early to fill up any water containers that are susceptible for a day is a hassle. The water interruption is a burden for 
                        all of us.
                        <br><br>
                        In the aspect of a student, we are greatly affected by it because we are students under the K-12 Curriculum which proves that we need to exert as much as we can 
                        to achieve our dream grades. Without water, we won't have the ability to exert what is needed for the water to serve as the fuel while our body humbly serves as the car.
                        <br><br>
                        Would you rather do such countless activities while your throat ran dry or rather do the activities with your throat stable?
                        <br><br>
                        All in all, water interruption is a problem that has to be addressed because it affects all of us. Every step we take counts, let us value water for it is a part of our life.

                    <h1 class="text-align-justify">Pimples, no more</h1>
                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar  |  Published on August 4, 2018</p><br>
                    <p>Afraid of making friends because of pimples? Looking for ways to eradicate it completely? Trying hard to conceal it by the use of concealers? 
                        Is that you? A teenager who experiences pimple outbreaks.
                        <br><br> 
                        Pimples usually develop after blackheads or whiteheads become inflamed and infected. This happens when the skin tries to adjust to hormonal 
                        changes that typically occur during puberty. The question is: Are you desperate to get rid of your pimples? If so, here are some ways to get rid of pimples.
                        <br><br>
                        First, cleanse your skin twice daily. Pimples and blackheads are more likely to appear if your skin is dirty. Use a facial soap or appropriate cleanser to 
                        remove makeup, excess oil, debris and bacteria from your skin.
                        <br><br>
                        Second, use witch hazel on your skin. Witch hazel acts as a natural substitute for toner or astringent. It helps to balance skin's oil levels and dry out pimples 
                        and blackheads. Use daily to promote clear skin.
                        <br><br>
                        Third, steam your skin.  By steaming your skin once to twice weekly, you'll experience fewer blackheads and pimples.
                        <br><br>
                        Fourth, create a paste by mixing equal parts baking soda and water. Apply the paste to your blackheads and pimples. Leave it on the affected skin for 
                        approximately 20 minutes before rinsing. The baking soda absorbs excess oil and kills bacteria, helping to get rid of your blackheads and pimples.
                        <br><br>
                        Fifth, Rub lemon juice on your blackheads and pimples. The natural acidity of lemon juice dries out skin, absorbing oil that causes blackheads and pimples. 
                        It also promotes a more even complexion, helping your skin to look smoother and healthier.
                        <br><br>
                        Lastly, exfoliate your skin. Create a scrub by mixing equal parts granulated sugar and water. Apply the scrub to your skin, using circular motions to exfoliate the area.
                        <br><br>
                        Do this everyday with the right prescriptions. Then you will live and enjoy your life with no hiding and using of concealers, and more importantly, free with pimples!</p><br> <hr/>

                    <p>Boy: Hey, look, someone posted himself with a cockroach crawling on his face!!!<br>
                        Girl: Is that for real? Omg, so disgusting!<br>
                        Boy: Indeed it is. What's more? He's smiling.<br>
                        Girl: So creepy. 
                        <br><br>
                        An anticipated conversation that perfectly describes how anyone will react upon seeing cockroaches in a human face just for the sake of being famous.
                        <br><br>
                        Receiving flood likes and a thousand reactions and shares as a Burmese youngster Alex Yung posted on his status a challenge: "The Cockroach Challenge." 
                        <br><br>
                        His post has him and a cockroach on his cheek which has been shared over 18,000 times. He added the caption," Can you do this?"
                        <br><br>
                        Spreading like a virus and as fast as a cheetah runs describing how this challenge tempted the mindset of youngsters all over the country. 
                        <br><br>
                        Cockroaches are commonly known as an insect to be disgusted by all genders. Some of them walk, and some flies make it scarier. 
                        <br><br>
                        Despite the fact that it is an insect, it is still a fright for all. Upon seeing them, you can already shout, what more if it touches your skin, henceforth, 
                        some may even discover themselves doing 'Mariah Carey's whistle register' as their throats run dry as they shout or scream.
                        <br><br>
                        But as time passes, many youngsters are ignoring that fact just for the sake of being famous on social networks. They are degrading themselves just for 
                        something insignificant. 
                        <br><br>
                        Therefore, will you let a fool challenge you or rather let a challenge fool you? It's up to you to decide!</p><br> <hr/>

                    <p>Daughter: Mommy, I want to ask you, what 3 words can make you feel in love?<br>
                        Mother: Is that even a question, of course it is I LOVE YOU, how about you my daughter?<br>
                        Daughter: Mom, for me, a movie is the one that made me fall in love. And that is HELLO, LOVE GOODBYE!
                        <br><br>
                        One word to describe the movie, <em>Hello, Love, Goodbye </em>  is AMAZING! All the production members of the movie did a great job. The movie was so beautiful 
                        that it even touched everyone's heart. I am not a Director.
                        <br><br>
                        I am not a Manager. But I can clearly see a promotion at the end of these 2 World-Widely Renowned Actors and Actresses namely Alden Richards and Kathryn 
                        Bernardo. Kathryn was popularly known as the girlfriend and loveteam of Daniel Padilla but the chemistry between Kathryn and Alden is something of an undeniable one.
                        <br><br>
                        Everything that happened in the movie was very unexpected. The acting was more than enough to satisfy each and everyone's desire, what more to the way they throw 
                        lines that have deep and different meanings.
                        <br><br>
                        Upon watching, different life-long lessons tainted my innocent mind namely:
                        <br><br>
                        In love, no matter how many times you get hurt, don't be scared to fall in love again and give the best. Love is a gambling , in the beginning you already know that 
                        you will get hurt but you still continue to play the gamble because even if it is hurt you know deep in your heart that the person you love is the one who is giving you the 
                        true happiness you need.
                        <br><br>
                        There's a lot of people that will just pass by in your life to change you . Not everyone is meant to stay with you, there are people who will just come in your life to teach 
                        you a lesson and sharpen you up to be a better person. We may thing he/she is the one for us, but actually, it's not. It is really hard but we need to accept it. 
                        They will just be part of a chapter of our life.
                        <br><br>
                        You have the right to recover from the failure you have from the past. Accept your mistakes, forgive yourself and learn from them. It is not too late!
                        <br><br>
                        You have all your time to change, you can get up and start again. We all deserve chances!

                    <p>"PINAKAMAMANGHA," said by Sandra Aguinaldo in her I-Witness episode entitled, 'Mga Pahina ng Kasaysayan' held at University of Sto. Tomas (UST) - 
                        The Pillar of Philippine History.
                        <br><br>
                        The UST is known for its 'history preservation.' They have always maintained any history clues since 1611-the year UST was established.
                        <br><br>
                        Every history holds a clue how a country was established or destroyed. Even the people we claim as heroes also hold significance for the 
                        reason that they became unhesitant of risking their own lives for the sake of others.
                        <br><br>
                        One of these heroes that still holds  great details about his life as a student is our National Hero, Dr Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda, 
                        most popularly renowned as Jose Rizal.
                        <br><br>
                        Lucky UST for being the University that Rizal studied at. All the places and all the books that Rizal studied are being treasured and maintained by the University.
                        <br><br>
                        "Ang Pagtatagpo ng Kahapon at Ngayon," this is how Sandra Aguinaldo described her feeling as she saw various items such as books, scripts, and many more, 
                        either from the Philippines or from other countries that are all worthy of being preserved.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite the fact that it is an insect, it is still a fright for all. Upon seeing them, you can already shout, what more if it touches your skin, henceforth, 
                        Saving our country's history means making ourselves part of it. So let us strive to save it.Though we may think of what way can we contribute to the heroes, 
                        well, by simply preserving what they had done for the country is the best thing to do but this isn't what we must only do, we must also love what they had done to show 
                        that we truly honor them.

                    <p>With so many LGBTQIA+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersexual, Asexual) teens struggling for freedom at the spot where their sexuality 
                        interacts with race, class, or gender identity. Love, Simon is definitely a movie to be their source of inspiration and courage to confess what they truly feel.
                        <br><br>
                        From the very start of the movie, I became hooked to it because it showed a complete normal high school teenager, Simon Spier who hides a huge secret 
                        that he never told anyone yet: he is gay. I bet that no one in my school has a huge secret which makes the movie completely RELATABLE.
                        <br><br>
                        As the movie continues, heartfelt friendship is clearly shown. Because in the movie, Simon dies and has three best friends that he can call his own. Naming Leah 
                        Burke, his 'bff' since birth, with Abby Suso and Nick Eisner. They share an unbreakable bond and that's what TRUE FRIENDSHIP is all about which Love, Simon 
                        expressed.
                        <br><br>
                        In the near end of the movie, Simon finally confessed that he is gay. At first, his friends did not approve but later on they accepted and they continued their 
                        normal high school life. That scene was so TEAR-BREAKING because they cried so much, it's so EMOTIONAL.
                        <br><br>
                        Although the movie is all about LGBTQ Community, it's not all that it's also about true friendship that any people deserve to have, and gaining confidence 
                        to confess what you truly feel. Because confessing means you are now free from those chains that are locking you in.</p><br> <hr/>

                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar  |  Published on November 28, 2019</p><br>
                    <p>People may think museums are too boring but when you visit it you'll learn about our history and are eager to understand more of this. As you enter, the National Museum of 
                        Fine Arts gives you goosebumps because of the colors that fill inside and each frame has a different story.
                        <br><br>
                        The thin crowds, the people who entered and exited rooms one after another, the silence that filled into the whole galleries, people contemplating the artworks and appreciating it 
                        at the same time and strolling around are common people inside the museum.
                        <br><br>
                        As you enter inside the museum you will see the 4.22 meters x 7.675 meters the largest painting in the Philippines by Juan Luna’s “Spoliarium”. The painting features a glimpse 
                        of Roman History. Spoliarium is the most valuable, iconic oil painting by Juan Luna and created in 1884. The first thing that will catch your eyes is the dead body being dragged to 
                        darkness, the crowd of people behind the stairs and the woman crying alone.
                        <br><br>
                        Inside the museum you will be inspired by the graphic painting of Felix Hidalgo. This painting known as “The Boat of Charon” was inspired by Dante Alighieri’s Inferno. The hand 
                        carved wooden frame is impressive because of the details of the fruits of the vine.
                        <br><br>
                        We Filipinos give honor to our Philippine National Hero, Dr. Jose Rizal who was also a skilled artist. This gallery will give an opportunity to see how good artworks show respect to 
                        our National Hero.
                        <br><br>
                        The National Museum also features various religious arts including a National Cultural Treasure.
                        <br><br>
                        Some of the amazing sculptures featuring the works of Isabelo Tampinci, one of the Philippines most celebrated sculptures. Tampinco’s most famous preserved world 
                        includes the Façade o the Manila Cathedral.
                        <br><br>
                        The spiral staircase is like an art because of the detail and design that captivated every person who visits the museum.
                        <br><br>
                        Our historical artists express their feelings through arts during the Spanish Era and it makes our literature remarkable. It also helped us 
                        to become free from the subjugation of the Spaniards before until now. Art speaks where words are unable to explain.</p><br> <hr/>

                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar  |  Published on November 28, 2019</p><br>
                    <p>Before, we valued white as peace, but not anymore!
                        <br><br>
                        Several Netizens are posting different stories as the number of teenagers being kidnapped rapidly rises and videos showing human meat have spread across social 
                        media. Despite having different stories to share, there is one thing they have in common: FEAR!
                        <br><br>
                        As I was scrolling through Social Media, I saw a post that says that near my Barangay, a kidnapping case was held through the medium of a White Van. 
                        As a teenager, I'll naturally be scared, not only me, but all the teenagers around me.
                        <br><br>
                        It's like, any car that I see as long as it's white, the inside of me is panicking. What if that car is just pretending to be a car but it's actually a van filled with kidnappers.
                        <br><br>
                        Anywhere isn't safe now. Courage alone is not something that you can use against them, you must also have the brain.
                        <br><br>
                        One of my classmates, Gerald Alea, posted on his social status that he was also about to be kidnapped by the Van. However, since he is an athlete at 
                        our school, he ran like crazy until he lost the man chasing him for he forcibly and randomly entered any door near him as he ran.
                        <br><br>
                        We need God at this time. This experience may be a tool to us that gives us the message that we have to turn back to 
                        God for us to be saved. Before doing anything else, we must pray.
                        <br><br>
                        As I could see, Prayer is the only weapon that we can fight against the killers and faithfulness is how we deliver the action needed.
                        <br><br>
                        Please, let the government and the Police Forces manage this situation and eradicate all these nuances. If this case will go up, I bet, 
                        in the next few years, we won't be seeing any teenagers around the Philippines as they all were kidnapped and sold by the syndicate.</p><br> <hr/>

                    <p>This is exactly the movie that proves that, "Truth will always set you free," as Elsa and Anna 
                        felt the joy that they haven't experienced before as the truth behind their parents' death was revealed.
                        <br><br>
                        Frozen II is a continuation of the main character's journey since they need to find the truth behind the 
                        story of what their father told them when they were children. Until the singing voice is heard, maddeningly 
                        persistent and it seems to be calling Elsa to a mysterious, magical forest.
                        <br><br>
                        What will you do if your kingdom is under attack by these magical manifestations of earth, air, fire and water? 
                        That's the dilemma she has to face. She's ready for another adventure: to investigate the voice. This time she knew that she wouldn't be alone.
                        <br><br>
                        Some say that this movie is the best movie ever, well, I can't disagree with that. Upon watching the whole movie, we can say that the plot twists did a 
                        great job as well as the graphics. Moreover, the soundtracks are super good. I expect the songs to still be famous years from now just like how 'Let It Go' 
                        became a timeless song.
                        <br><br>
                        Amazing! The movie can be the best ever Disney Movie for we are undoubtedly amazed by the plot. Who would have known that the reason why Elsa 
                        had powers is because of her mother's native town which is a magical one for the reason that spirits and other magical creatures reside within.
                        <br><br>
                        Characters fall from some significant heights. One freezes. Two slide down a massive hill in an icy boat, eventually landing in a rushing, giant-infested river.
                        <br><br>
                        In the end, it's all about the love of two sisters. It is stronger than Elsa's fearsome freezing powers since they both sacrifice specially Anna is willing to make 
                        for her sister powerful and at times, profound. Indeed it is the best movie ever!</p><br> <hr/>

                    <p>It is a good year to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Philippine Cinema as news about the Philippines winning back to back in the 30th Sea Games 
                        are all over the country.
                        <br><br>
                        Philippine Cinema was first established in 1897. Before, the use of pictures were the only things that are used, however in the current days cinemas were 
                        portrayed and are widely used and until now, the cinemas still hold a place in the modern world.
                        <br><br>
                        In a normal cinema, there won't be much excitement without the romance for it is the only thing that we can be connected and so to do that, here is the

                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar  |  Published on December 12, 2019</p><br>
                    <p>Farewell follows sadness but for the Sergio Osmenia Sr. High School, farewell means a new beginning.
                        <br><br>
                        The Sergio Osmenia Sr. High School or SOSHS' Former Principal Maximo P. Placio is now destined at Don Alejandro Roces Sr. Science and Technology High School 
                        whilst our new Principal Mrs. Adora B. Teano was the Former Principal of P. Bernardo High School.
                        <br><br>
                        Principals are once teachers and therefore Mam Adora is not an exception. One of the greatest achievements of Mam Teano when she was still a teacher is when 
                        her students come back and inform her that they have been successful.
                        <br><br>
                        She served 20 years in the teaching industry. However, she became a Principal by July 2016.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite being a Principal, she had this most memorable experience when she was a teacher. It is when parents come to personally thank her that she became 
                        the adviser of their children.
                        <br><br>
                        A Principal naturally wishes for the best thing she could give to the school. And with that, Mrs. Teano wishes that the Sergio Osmenia Sr. High School will be one 
                        of the best schools all over the Division of Quezon City.
                        <br><br>
                        Most teachers are all praised to her, it is because that despite the fact that she is new to the school,she had already contributed a lot for our that means a lot to us
                        <br><br>
                        One of her accomplishments that she did was to renovate the 4th Floor of the Osmenia Building and transform it to an Audio Visual Room (AVR) that is larger than 
                        what others schools have. Also, she supervised the 20 Most Outstanding Teachers of 2019 event which our adviser topped the list, Mrs. Josephine Porcadilla.
                        <br><br>
                        She really impressed us a lot and let us hope for more accomplishments in the near future.</p>

                    <h1 class="text-align-justify">PH, officially smoke free</h1>
                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar  |  Published on May 20, 2017</p><br>
                    <p>The Executive Order NO. 26 entitled Providing for the Establishment of a Smoke Free Environment in Public and Enclosed Places, was issued by the Philippine 
                        President Rodrigo Roa Duterte last May 16, 2017. Due to this, many people gave positive feedback while some did the opposite.
                        <br><br>
                        This law was established in order to minimize the access to tobacco products, in order to provide a more supportive environment for those who are 
                        attempting to quit tobacco use which definitely pleased a lot of consumers.
                        <br><br>
                        This law is also beneficial for Filipinos who are fed up with inhaling second-hand smoke.Second-hand smoking is an indirect smoking that the person is inhaling 
                        the smoke the other person breathes out using the tobacco. In public places, these are most commonly experienced because many people just randomly smoke 
                        everywhere which is displeasing to others as they have no choice but to inhale it as well. Therefore, this law is very useful in such circumstances. 
                        <br><br>
                        On the dark side, few Filipinos who lived their life being used to smoking have to give up for the sake of their lives. They were used to smoking in public and 
                        private places which is now a restricted area. If they do it, they will get arrested, which displeases the majority of smokers.
                        <br><br>
                        Having this law passed does not mean smoking is banned. It can still be used but not in restricted areas such as public places and workplaces.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, Duterte has taken one step closer to make our country a more desirable and a more organized one. A country with no harm, drug and crime 
                        free and especially smoke free.</p><br><hr/>

                    <h1 class="text-align-justify">The Truth Untold</h1>
                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar  |  Published on June 09, 2018</p><br>
                    <p>Ever feel pressured because of high expectations? Ever been depressed due to lengthy assignments and tons of projects to rush with? Ever tried to stay up late 
                        at night just to memorize your whole reviewer for a quiz the next day? Lastly, did you ever use the time allotted for you to enjoy life with your friends and family 
                        but lent that time to comply with your requirements? Sadly, but all the answers are YES!
                        <br><br>
                        We are aware that schools nurture students to be great individuals who will lead the future someday but currently, do you think the students are still the hope we 
                        once dreamed to be? Yes, we are indeed the hope of the future but it is clearly a 'no' for the way the learning curriculum treats the students as 'robots'.
                        <br><br>
                        "You're the doer of your own grades. We're just encoders," the K12 teachers' most common line. Henceforth, if a student does not comply with any requirements, 
                        they'll immediately get an 'egg' score. However, in some cases that a student may not comply is because of medical issues and family affairs, although it's true 
                        that all teachers may accept that as a reason for being unable to comply, however, they aren't compromised any grade even though the reason is valid. That's even 
                        the more reason why some students commit suicide because of tons of assignments to finish and be passed immediately after the day it was tasked to do.
                        <br><br>
                        This isn't the life that we students deserve. A life where all the negativity fosters and a life in a judgemental and technology-based world. We are forced to 
                        memorize, either lesson, answers, formulas and definitions instead of fully understanding them. We are being distracted by cellphones instead of reviewing. We lack 
                        confidence in recitations and oral reports. Yet, the school expects us to do well and exert more effort when in fact, we are already tired from doing much of those works? 
                        It's not teaching at this point, we basically just go to school and come home doing some more activities and homeworks just to meet our desired grades.
                        <br><br>
                        The truth that students may seem physically stable but mentally exhausted holds true but yet to be told.
                        <br><br>
                        Indeed, a sad reality.</p><br><hr/>

                    <h1 class="text-align-justify">Supporting Equality is Supporting SOGIE</h1>
                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar  |  Published on August 20, 2019</p><br>
                    <p>Along with racial equality and the late bloom of women's respective rights, future generations may explain how in the past, gays were misunderstood and publicly 
                        humiliated for loving each other and eventually, how they stood together and conquered stupidity and hypocritical loathes and found their way out of marginalization.
                        <br><br>
                        Though in the current world, people who are discriminating them are still present, still, it's it's only a matter of time 'till their life goes tic-toc on their life' s majestic 
                        clock as the power of SOGIE enters the show.
                        <br><br>
                        The Sexual Orientation Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE) Equality Bill that was proposed mainly by the LGBTQIA+ Community that greatly suffice their need 
                        for equality. Striking up hundreds of beliefs, as some approve of this bill while some deems this bill as an idiotic approach to equality.
                        <br><br>
                        Arguments are all over the internet. The SOGIE BILL indeed aroused a good number of different and opposing ideologies and Students are not an exception.
                        <br><br>
                        Students are divided. Some enjoy the fact that they can have the freedom they need. They can feel special, feel protected and feel safe. Glad that they can finally 
                        have a break from such humiliation and discrimination.
                        <br><br>
                        On the contrary, the other half cannot stand the stupidity of the bill. Many insisted that if the bill will be approved, a gay can have his chance to barge in on the 
                        women's restroom and whoever sees him will be punished by the Sogie Bill.
                        <br><br>
                        If they worry about the gay who barged in and other circumstances. Then let the SOGIE be the tool to punish the people who are using this bill for their own 
                        benefit. The women inside the restroom can get a clear picture of the gay men entering their cr premises and use social media to punish him and later on being 
                        punished by the bill itself as the news reach the authorities.
                        <br><br>
                        We must all be open minded about this. Only thinking about the negative side of the bill will only worsen the situation. Let us give all our best to support the bill 
                        because supporting this bill means supporting LGBTQ+, henceforth, supporting EQUALITY.</p><br><hr/>

                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar  |  Published on August 30, 2019</p><br>
                    <p>Homeworks is meant to be the medium of learning for each student outside the school grounds. They help the students prepare for a lesson tomorrow to easily keep up. 
                        But unlike before, the homeworks is lesser, the students of today claim it as too much. Tons of schoolworks to finish and to be passed immediately after the day it was 
                        tasked to do...until finally, the burden was lifted.
                        <br><br>
                        With the push of the Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Briones proposed the No Homework Policy that is meant to provide the family time that students must have.
                        <br><br>
                        Several students are surely celebrating the fact that their burden in doing homeworks will now be lessened but do we have an assurance that if they have the time, they will 
                        use it for their families or just stick their eyes out to their cell phone for entertainment.
                        <br><br>
                        Parents are divided. Some enjoy the fact that their children can have the free time, either use it for family or just rest while some are also opposing the policy reasoning 
                        that their children can also benefit from having homeworks for their learning benefits.
                        <br><br>
                        On the other hand, teachers also have something to say. The K-12 Teachers most common line is, "You're the doer of your own grades. We're just the encoders." 
                        Therefore, if the homeworks will be gone from the curriculum, their output means lesser and lesser outputs defines a low grade.
                        <br><br>
                        Though some may accept the policy, however, how can we approve of this policy without any assurance it will be effective in a way that is beneficial? We must plan 
                        this policy carefully before revealing it to the public because if we fail to plan, we're simply planning to fail.</p><br><hr/>

                    <p>"Nasa huli ang pagsisisi," a Filipino renowned quote that best describes Senator Cynthia Villar as she clarified her pre-statement that she was against research works.
                        <br><br>
                        "Ba't ba adik na adik kayo sa research. Ako, matalino akong tao pero di ko maintindihan yang research niyo, " said Villar. As her speech gradually spread throughout the 
                        country, several netizens gave their response to her that if she truly is intelligent, how come she doesn't understand the essence of research.
                        <br><br>
                        Everything that revolves around us are all products of research. Therefore, describing research as insignificant is absolutely futile because technology and innovation 
                        is by itself formed due to countless researches.
                        <br><br>
                        Aside from being high school students, we are also Researchers. We know how to invent things that are actually beneficial to all sectors. Our past research is about 
                        proving mangosteen as a natural staining agent for microscopic purposes and it is a winning piece in Science Research and is beneficial to both students and teachers.
                        <br><br>
                        Likewise, our Center for Excellence in Research and Student Leadership (CENTREX) Research’ that talks about the Effects of Introversion in School's Learning Cooperation 
                        which is important to bridge Learning Cooperation in all Schools' Scope.
                        <br><br>
                        That is how important research is. Without research, there'll be no technology and without technology, there'll be no innovation and without innovation, we won't be as 
                        what we are now.
                        <br><br>
                        Just as the saying goes, 'Think before you click,' and this applies exactly to Villar. She must think before saying anything to the public that is deemed to be offensive. 
                        What's the purpose of being intelligent, if the way you use it is the worst. Though Villar had already clarified that she wasn't actually against research works, it is already 
                        too late because several netizens have already spread the word throughout the country and therefore, Villar cannot escape from the criticisms.</p><br>

                    <p>Rainy Season has set foot!
                        <br><br>
                        The Philippines is known for actively participating in various international games. However, most of the time, sports athletes are the breadwinner of our country. 
                        Most of the athletes do their name in our history and go home with victory as they represented our beloved country.
                        <br><br>
                        When it comes to sports people usually choose male athletes rather than female athletes but female Filipina athletes prove themselves that sports is not only for 
                        man as they win their games and get home with their smiles together with their medals of being an international winner.
                        <br><br>
                        Here are the lists of top 10 Filipina athletes of all time and bring home a title and a victorious story:
                        <br><br>
                        The one who topped on the list is Hidilyn Diaz, known for weightlifting. She's just not an athlete nor an enlisted personnel of the Philippine Air Force. Hidilyn may 
                        have lost in London in 2012, but still, she stood up and finally got the prize when she became the silver medalist in 2016 Rio Olympics.
                        <br><br>
                        Second is Lydia de Vega-Mercado, a retired sprinter who made a name of being "Asia's fastest woman" in the 80's. The Asian sprint queen is a back-to-back gold 
                        medalist in the Asian Games. Despite having a break, she came back, and she's still strong by winning another gold medal in the Manila Sea Games in 1991.
                        <br><br>
                        Elma Muros-Posadas is the third female athlete of all time. She has been named as the "Long Jump Queen of the Philippines" in her prime years. She possessed 
                        great power as she won medals every year up until she retired. She is now a coach in an exclusive international school, sharing her knowledge and experience of 
                        being an award winning athlete during her times.
                        <br><br>
                        Next is Mary Joy Tabal, a Cebuana who fought for her place to represent the 2017 SEA Games and she proved herself that it is a wise decision as she got and 
                        gave her first gold medal in our country. She is currently in Italy preparing for the Asian Games.
                        <br><br>
                        Toni Leviste one of the Filipina equestrian athletes. She competed in international competitions and represented the Philippines as her country. Like the others, 
                        she also  comes back home carrying the medals symbol for her triumph in the international games. Toni was awarded the Philippines Sportswriter Association (PSA) 
                        Rider of the year award from 1992 until 2015.
                        <br><br>
                        Alyssa Valdez, volleyball, the former Ateneo Lady Eagle has not only been MVP in the UAAP, but her prowess in volleyball has also earned her a season of playing in 
                        Thailand – a proof that female Filipino athletes are at par with our neighbors in the region. She has also been the flag bearer during the 2015 SEA Games held in Singapore.
                        <br><br>
                        Bea Lucero-Lhuillier, remember that Milo advert where someone helped out a struggling young gymnast in the balance beam? It was Bea who starred there, relieving 
                        her days as a young gymnast herself. She was the first Filipino Olympian who brought home a bronze medal for taekwondo at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
                        <br><br>
                        Akiko Thomson, she was one of the greatest swimmers that ever represented the country in the international level. This may not be known to many, but Thomson 
                        is a naturalized Filipino. That fact did not hinder her from representing the Philippines as proud as she can be, though.
                        <br><br>
                        Marielle Benitez, she served the women’s football team as captain from 1999 up until her retirement in 2015. Her leadership skills have taken her up a notch by 
                        becoming the coach of the women’s U16 football team. Apart from that, Benitez is also a member of the Bayanihan Dance Troupe,

                        bearer in the said international meet – her last competition prior to her break after being diagnosed with leukemia.broadcaster and has a degree in Psychology.
                        <br><br>
                        These female athletes would make not just their mommas proud, but also all of the super women out there. Their love for the country is immeasurable, and their 
                        passion for their chosen sport is truly unimaginable. These are just 10 names out of the many who make it all the more worthy to be proud being a Filipino.</p><br><hr/>

                    <p>Failures are just stepping stones for Mya Kalani Avila Wilson as she competed in the 30th Southeast Asian Games 2019 (SEA GAMES) and represented our home 
                        country, Philippines, in the Women's Gymnastics Competition as she defeated 20 other gymnasts in the Women All-around Finals despite her young age, 16.
                        <br><br>
                        Challenges are indeed inevitable. Athletes are not an exception and therefore, Mya is too. She also experienced several challenges, especially all the traveling she's 
                        been through, from her hotel to the training center, also she was also challenged by getting used to the time differences for she was living outside the country before 
                        she was here.
                        <br><br>
                        Even the huge crowd is also her problem because she isn't used to it and more importantly, competing against athletes who have far more greater experience than 
                        she has. But, still, she set aside these problems and performed well at the Sea Games 2019 and proved that Age doesn't matter when it comes to proving your talents.
                        <br><br>
                        According to an interview, on the scale of 1-100 the percentage that the Filipinos supported her, before and after the contest, was 100%. This is the reason why Mya 
                        was able to perform very well in the said competition is because of the cheers of the Filipinos, the same level that we give Yulo a praise.
                        <br><br>
                        However, as the contest had happened as we were watching it live, an incident happened. She did a mistake in landing her move and was left with a score of 6. But 
                        her coach, also her stepfather, Cliff Parks, comforted her the most and what Mya did to calm herself was to think of positive thoughts, breathing and smiling.
                        <br><br>
                        "Falling down is an accident, staying down is a choice," a quote by Mya Wilson as that incident did not hinder her success in the continuing contest. It's okay for her 
                        to have that type of grade for she did her best to do the stunt, except what happened in the landing that let her score to subside, because she is only at 16 years old 
                        and the same age as us which proves that she still has a long way to go for her to further develop her abilities.
                        <br><br>
                        There is always time for everything. Who knows, what if when Mya turns 19,the same age as Yulo when he received a gold medal, is the age where Mya can also 
                        receive a gold medal the same Yulo did in his age. So there's really time for everything, and to do that, practice is a significant factor and patience is a fundamental unit.
                        <br><br>
                        Mya Wilson is a great example of an athlete for us that despite the hardships and obstacles that binds our success, there is and will always be a solution and no matter 
                        what, your friends are there to support you and more importantly your family.
                        <br><br>
                        Several years from now, we can see Mya continuing to represent the Philippines in various international competitions and further proving her skills.
                        <br><br>
                        "Always love what you're doing and when times get rough, remember why you love it." - Mya Wilson, Women's Gymnastics Philippine Athlete, 2019.</p><br>

                    <h1 class="text-align-justify">Being Lazy: A product of Technology?</h1>
                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar</p><br>
                    <p>CONVENIENT. A 10-lettered word that perfectly describes today's era where everything can be done in just one click!
                        <br><br>
                        We cannot deny the fact that even at least once in our lives, we relied on technology. May it be through using your cellphones, playing games using your devices, 
                        online shopping and selling, and using electronic devices, these are all products of technology that we daily use. Technically, technology made our lives easier and 
                        convenient for us to live peacefully, however, since we became too reliant on technology, we developed laziness…and that is a fact we shouldn't deny! 
                        <br><br>
                        Dominic Jackson (n. d.) stated that technology has made us lazy due to the following reasons: [1] No need to leave the house for entertainment; [2] No need to 
                        use paper maps for navigation; [3] No need to go to libraries to look for answers; [4] No need to run errands personally. Truthfully speaking, all of those holds 
                        truth, that is why technology made us lazy because anything that we must do can be solved just by using our devices because there are several services there 
                        that could meet our needs.
                        <br><br>
                        We may have become lazy, but it is a fact that we should not disregard it's good side as it improved everyone's day-to-day life in a progressing manner. Always take 
                        note that the technology itself does mean no harm, only how people use it do. Therefore, we should strive for the best and do what we can without being too 
                        dependent on technology because when the time comes where technology suddenly deteriorated, it's us who'll suffer.</p><br><hr/>

                    <h1 class="text-align-justify">To be Lazy is To be Smart</h1>
                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar</p><br>
                    <p>Growing up as someone lazy is a life I don’t regret having. My name is Jethro James Aguilar, 18 years old, a certified <em>smart lazy</em> person.
                        <br><br>
                        A common misconception about lazy people is the fact that they don’t get things done, but in fact, they do. They just find new ways to speed up their work process 
                        so they can reduce the amount of work they have to do ...and this is totally me! I remember the time when I was doing some paperwork that my brother used to do. 
                        Instead of signing his students’ individual output, I used a stapler and sorted the students’ outputs, then I signed it only on the first page because I don’t want to go 
                        to the trouble of signing each output one-by-one. That’s why my brother was shocked when I was lying around when I was literally doing his work just a few minutes 
                        ago. The bottom line is that even if I am lazy, it doesn’t mean I don’t get things done, I am just fast because I use 100% of my brain in thinking of new ways to get 
                        thing done quicker so I don’t spend too much time on doing something. Therefore, I believe that I am considered as someone who is not only lazy but a smart lazy 
                        person.
                        <br><br>
                        This may be hard to believe that being a lazy person can be related to being smart, however, such characteristic is possible as several studies have already proven 
                        such. According to Alyse Kalish (n. d.), she noted a recent study published in The Independent which suggests that lazy people might be brainier than those who are 
                        constantly active:<em> “…people with a high IQ get bored less easily, leading them to spend more time engaged in thought…non-thinkers get bored more easily, so 
                        [they] need to fill their time with physical activity.” </em>This means that smart lazy people are drowned in thoughts as they are thinking of ways to speed up their 
                        work.
                        <br><br>
                        Speaking about smart laziness, a certain fictional character, an anime character to be exact, comes into my mind, and that is Shikamaru Nara, a shinobi from Naruto 
                        Series who utilizes shadow techniques. I really relate myself to Shikamaru because our characters and qualities are very similar. I am lazy, so he is. I am smart, so 
                        he is. I am intelligent, so he is. I remember this specific fight scene where he fought Temari, a shinobi skilled in using weapons, every time it felt like she had the 
                        upper hand, it turned out that Shikamaru was ten steps ahead of her. He fooled her into thinking that his shadow wasn’t reaching her, making her put her guard 
                        down until, suddenly, she was caught by his ‘jutsu’ from behind. This scene showed Shikamaru’s intelligence which shook to the bone that he is willing to fool others 
                        just to finish the game quicker with a taste of brilliance.</p><br><hr/>

                        mine, the Philippines, it seems like a far-fetched dream.
                        <br><br>
                        Philippines is ranked 112th among 180 countries in terms of Environmental Health according to Environmental Performance Index (2018). It is low; however, I see why 
                        it is because even at my hometown, trashes are basically like our neighbors.
                        <br><br>
                        Therefore, given an opportunity to appeal to our local politicians, I would recommend for them to do the following actions or programs to minimize waste: [1] Zero 
                        Waste – a program that would encourage residents to collect trashes and gain money from doing so; [2] Pay for what you throw – a rule that lets the person who 
                        throw their trashes anywhere to pay for what they did.
                        <br><br>
                        To start with, Zero Waste. It is a program that I use to manage at School as an Officer, therefore, I know how it works. Basically, we just collect trashes and for every 
                        trash we collect, the teachers (which in this case, the politicians) would pay for those in a reasonable price to encourage the families to participate in making the 
                        environment green.
                        <br><br>
                        Lastly, pay for what you throw. A rule that I watched other countries were doing when somebody throws trashes anywhere, they make them pay. Even if it was just 
                        a candy wrapper, there is no escape. Therefore, such thing in our neighborhood is a must to impose fear among the residents who still plan on doing such things 
                        when they can just throw it in trash bags. 
                        <br><br>
                        “Cleanliness is indeed next to godliness” (Wesley, line 1), which means that we have the duty to keep our homes clean. Therefore, if we want our future generations 
                        to live in a wonderful place, then we must act now because actions speak better than words.</p><br><hr/>

                    <p class="text-align-justify">By: Jethro James S. Aguilar</p><br>
                    <p>“Youth is the hope of our future.” A quotation said by our National Hero, Dr. Jose Rizal, which is widely used because it’s true that the youth contributes his/her 
                        idea/platforms to the benefit of the whole. However, ever since the pandemic started, changes happened. What used to be the time for seminars and trainings to 
                        mold the youth to become great leaders was temporarily stopped and now has continued through online platforms. As such, many problems had risen such as 
                        inactive participation due to internet connectivity issues, low signal, lack of gadgets, and lack of management of time in studying and handling household chores. 
                        Therefore, if the youth cannot solve these issues themselves, how can we entrust them with our future
                        <br><br>
                        Firstly, Time Management is a must for the youth. It is due to time management that even if we have to do so many tasks, we can still finish it within the day as 
                        long as we follow the set schedules. Making it relevant today, platforms such as Google Classroom, Google Drive, and Microsoft Teams are mostly being used to 
                        post assignments or projects that student or the youth should comply. If we apply time management in such cases, we can finish these assignments ahead of 
                        time and be prepared for sudden activities without having to worry about cramming and also doing other things such as strolling on malls with friends or family 
                        and doing household chores.
                        <br><br>
                        Secondly, being aware. The youth must be aware, not only on their assignments at school but also the news. This is because only by being aware will the youth 
                        be able to be updated on current happenings. Other than that, being aware is also correlated to being factual because if you are factual means, you are aware of 
                        facts and that you don’t believe on something unless proven. This is important because fake news is very relevant to today’s era where lots of fake news are 
                        circulating through media platforms, therefore if the youth are factual, they can convince someone to not believe something because it’s fake and you something 
                        to support that argument.
                        <br><br>
                        Lastly, be sociable. There are cases where the youth are shy to even try making new friends and this is wrong because being sociable will help the youth be able 
                        to solve problems they cannot do alone and can only be solved with the help of another. Making it relevant today, if a student cannot join an online meeting, 
                        he/she can ask his/her friends to make some notes for him/her to study offline. As such, internet loss is no longer an issue.
                        <br><br>
                        Other that what is said, there may be more suggestion that’ll make youth become greater than what they are now, however the bottom-line is they should be 
                        driven to improve themselves and solve problems on their own. Because only then can they prove that they can be great leaders and worthy to be entrusted 
                        with our future.</p><hr/>
